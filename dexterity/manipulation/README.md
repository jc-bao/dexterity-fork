# Manipulation Task Library

## Task Overview

### Reach

Successively controlling the fingers of the hand to reach goal locations in 3D space. Since this is an ill-posed problem for an underactuated hand, we use the Adroit version of the Shadow Hand which is fully-actuated.

### Reorient

Reorienting the OpenAI cube to a goal orientation.
